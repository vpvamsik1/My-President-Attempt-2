			<p>This is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Trump"><font color="red"><b>Donald J. Trump</b></font></a>, the 45th President of the United States. <a href="my-webpage.html">Last time</a>, I touched on how "he has me made me happy and dissappointed me." Now in April of 2018, he has indubitably done more bad than good. I will showcase exactly what those are in the next section as his accomplishments so far again.</p>
			<p>Now even though his policies have been pretty bad, his demeanor has been quite the contrary. I <font color="red"><b>LOVE</b></font> his demeanor and the way he presents himself and I will go over that as well in the following sections.

<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script> The Women's March was supposed to be a pro-woman, anti-Trump march. So he tweets this out, basically giving it a metaphorical middle finger, which was awesome and hilarious.

			<div class="clear"></div>
			<p>It is important to note that there are many more tweets like that than there of Trump saying authoritarian things. I also love the way he presents himself and how he could care less about political correctness or social justice.</p>
